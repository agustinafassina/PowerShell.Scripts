# PowerShell Script: Copy Folder and Create ZIP Archive

This script copies the entire contents of the `v1` folder into a new folder named `v2` (creating it if it doesn't exist), and then compresses the `v2` folder into a ZIP archive named `v2.zip`.

## Usage
1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the script's location.
2. Run the script:

```powershell
.\CreateZip.ps1
